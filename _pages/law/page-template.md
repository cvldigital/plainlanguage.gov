## Plain Writing Act of 2010

[The Plain Writing Act of 2010](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ274/content-detail.html) promotes clear government communication that the public can understand and use. The Office of Management and Budget issued [final guidance to implement the law on April 13, 2011](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2011/04/19/putting-it-plainly).

At [Agency Name], we are committed to writing in plain language and using the [Federal Plain Language Guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidelines/):

We have assigned staff to oversee our plain language efforts:
