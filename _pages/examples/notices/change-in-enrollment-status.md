Dear addressee:

This letter is about the change in your enrollment during the period that began on September 1, 1996\. Because of this change, we may have paid you more than you were due.

### What Our Records Show

You reduced your credit hours from 12 hours to 6 hours on November 5, 1996.

### What We Did

We reduced your payments on December 1, 1996 to $202.00 per month. You will receive another letter about this change. The letter will show if you have a debt.

### What We Need

Please send us a statement explaining why you reduced the number of your credit hours. In most cases, we require evidence to support your statement. If you do not have supporting evidence, please tell us why. (See the enclosure Changes in Your Enrollment.)

### When We Need It

Send us your statement with any supporting evidence within 30 days.

### What We Will Do

If we accept your statement, we will not reduce your payments from the beginning date of the term. If a debt has already been created it must be repaid, but the debt will not be increased.

If we do not accept your statement with supporting evidence we will reduce your payments on September 1, 1996, the beginning date of the term. This will create a debt which you must repay.

If you do not respond within 30 days, we will reduce your payments on September 1, 1996, the beginning date of the term. This will create a debt which you must repay. Although we will take this action, we will consider information received from you within one year from the date of this letter. (We may extend this time limit if you show a good reason why you could not meet it.)

### Your Rights

You have basic rights that are available to you before we make a final decision on your claim. (See the enclosure Basic Rights.)

Sincerely,
