_The Department of Health and Human Services took a six-page article and replaced it with a single, fold-out brochure, conveying the same information. Here is an excerpt._

* #### Before

  The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends a half hour or more of moderate physical activity on most days, preferably every day. The activity can include brisk walking, calisthenics, home care, gardening, moderate sports exercise, and dancing.

* #### After

  Do at least 30 minutes of exercise, like brisk walking, most days of the week.
