## Johnson Space Center Handbook Chapter

## Before

_**_ 207.1 Introduction

For JSC emergencies, call x33333\. For Ellington Field emergencies, call x47231\. For White Sands Test Facility emergencies, call x5911\. Off site, call 911\. The first priority of a person on site who observes an outbreak of fire or other situation that constitutes an emergency is to immediately contact the emergency phone numbers for assistance. In many cases, immediate evacuation of a facility or area may be necessary. Notification and evacuation are to have priority over attempts by untrained personnel to combat the emergency. It is JSC policy that employees not "fight" fires that cannot be safely extinguished with a hand held fire extinguisher unless such employees are certified members of a fire brigade or any formally organized fire department. Employees should not try to fight a fire unless they first notify the fire department, are trained in fire extinguisher use, and can safely extinguish the fire.

207.2 Purpose

The purpose of this chapter is to provide guidelines for reporting an emergency and details what shall be contained in emergency action plans that give information and guidance to building personnel after an incident has been discovered.

207.3 Scope

This chapter applies to the reporting of medical and fire emergencies and emergencies involving a hazardous substance anywhere on JSC property, including Ellington Field and the Sonny Carter Training Facility. Also included are guidelines for general emergency action plans in each of the JSC and Ellington Field buildings.

207.4 Responsibility

207.4.1 Directors

Directors of organizations are responsible for the following actions:

a. Ensuring that emergency action plans are developed for their assigned facilities.

b. Appointing and providing for the training of facility managers for the building and/or facility.

c. Ensuring that hazards in or near the workplace are identified and properly mitigated.

d. Ensuring that the employees in the facility are aware of hazards of the workplace and are properly trained in the appropriate actions to take in emergency situations.

207.4.2 Supervisors

Supervisors are responsible for the following actions:

a. Encouraging employee participation in developing and writing emergency action plans.

b. Instructing their employees in the procedures contained in the emergency action plan.

c. Ensuring their employees are trained in how to recognize and protect themselves from hazards in the workplace.

d. Procedures to account for employees after evacuation.

e.. Ensuring their employees abide by the requirements of their emergency action plan and follow the instructions of fire wardens and emergency response personnel during an emergency.

207.4.3 Facility Managers

Facility managers are responsible for the following actions:

a. Appointment of assistant fire wardens as required

b. Development of building emergency evacuation plans

c. Inspection of facilities for hazards and ensuring corrective action is taken to mitigate the hazards

d. Ensuring the proper training of occupants in building emergency action plans

e. Familiarity with evacuation routes within the facility and ensuring physically impaired occupants are assisted during emergencies

207.4.4 Employees

Each employee is responsible for knowing the following:

a. How to recognize and protect themselves from hazards in their workplace

b. How to accurately report an emergency (dial the proper emergency number from a safe location) and notify other facility occupants according to the emergency action plan

c. What action should be taken after the report has been made

d. What is contained in the emergency action plan for his/her area or facility

e. What actions he/she is to take when an emergency situation is discovered

f. Where the facility designated safe area is so they can be accounted for after an evacuation

207.4.5 Physically Impaired Persons

See Employee Requiring Evacuation Assistance (EREA) policy from ESC. The JSC Personnel Office and the building fire warden are responsible for the training of physically impaired persons and those assigned to assist them for emergency evacuation from JSC buildings.

207.5 Emergency Reporting

207.5.1 Reporting a Fire or Other Emergency

All fires or other emergencies must be reported immediately by telephone. The person reporting the emergency by telephone or manual building fire alarm station should, if possible, meet the facility manager or responding emergency personnel as they enter the building. Any fire, even a small one or one that has already been extinguished, must be reported. When reporting an emergency to the JSC Security dispatcher on x33333 (at Ellington Field, x4723l; at WSTF, x5911), it is essential that as much information as possible be given the dispatcher so that the appropriate emergency personnel can be directed to the scene.

For example, if an actual fire is observed, perform these actions in the following order:

1\. Evacuate personnel from the building by activating a manual pull station. This will ring the building fire alarm bells and send a signal to the fire station security/dispatcher.

2\. Confirm the alarm by telephoning the appropriate emergency phone number from a safe location

(a) State " I am calling to report a fire..."

(b) Give details as to the exact location (bldg and room #), size of the fire, and type of fire (chemical, electrical, paper, etc.)

(c) Stay on the line until directed by the dispatcher

3\. Only attempt to extinguish the fire if

(a) The fire is small

(b) You have been trained in the use of portable fire extinguishers

(c) There is no risk to your safety

(d) You are confident of your ability to extinguish the fire

If an odor of smoke is detected, it should be reported as a smoke odor, along with the vicinity where the odor was first detected and the reporter's name and extension.

If an explosion, escaping gas, or chemical or flammable liquid spill has taken place; the materials involved, if known; and an indication of the extent of the emergency should be reported. Give the dispatcher the reporter's name and telephone extension.

207.5.2 Reporting a Medical Emergency

When reporting an accident or medical emergency to the JSC Security dispatcher on x33333 (at Ellington Field, x4723l; at WSTF, x5111), it is essential that as much information as possible be given to the dispatcher so that the appropriate emergency personnel can be directed to the scene. State "I am calling to report an accident/medical emergency. Please send an ambulance to..." If possible, have someone meet the responding emergency personnel at a predetermined entrance of the building to provide exact

directions.

207.5.2.1 Life-Threatening Injury or Illness

In the case of a life-threatening injury or illness, perform these functions in the following order:

1\. Notify the appropriate emergency phone number dispatcher of the exact location of the incident including building and room number, if applicable.

2\. Report the type and severity of the injury or illness and the name of the patient if known.

3\. Give reporter's name and telephone extension.

4\. Do not move the injured person without directions from professional medical personnel or unless it is clearly a life-threatening situation or location.

5\. Provide first aid assistance to the injured person until emergency personnel arrive.

207.5.2.2 Non-Life-Threatening Injury or Illness

In the case of a non-life-threatening injury or illness, perform these functions in the following order:

1\. Notify the appropriate emergency phone number dispatcher of the exact location of the incident including building and room number.

2\. Report the type and severity of the injury and that it does not appear to be life-threatening.

3\. Give the dispatcher the reporter's name and telephone extension.

207.6 Emergency Action Plan

207.6.1 Facilities

Each facility or building at JSC is required to have an emergency action plan designed to protect employees and property in the event of an emergency. JSC 05900, "JSC Emergency Preparedness Plan," describes the Center's overall planned response to emergencies.

However, there are critical areas within JSC facilities where the occurrence of an emergency such as a fire or other related mishap (flammable liquid spill, etc.) would demand a unique response from workers in the area, the safety organization, the security force, and responding firefighters or emergency medical service personnel. Consequently, comprehensive planning should be undertaken after a thorough analysis of the potential hazard has been completed. While even office-type facilities require a basic emergency action plan, the following target areas may require more extensive preplanning consideration:

a. Essential electronic equipment areas.

b. Aircraft hangars.

c. Chemical laboratories or any area containing hazardous chemicals.

d. Transformers.

e. Road routes for the transportation of hazardous materials.

f. Vital record storage areas.

g. Any area using/storing hazardous materials.

h. Test areas involving human subjects.

207.6.2 Assistance in Preplanning

The JSC or WSTF Emergency Planning Office (EPO) can provide assistance and advice to responsible organizations in the preparation of emergency action plans and in coordination of requirements and procedures.

207.6.3 Emergency Action Plan Requirements

An emergency action plan should cover the designated actions that must be taken to ensure employee safety from emergencies. The JSC EPO has prepared a document titled "Tips for Writing an Emergency Action Plan" that contains detailed guidelines and a sample plan outline that may be useful in developing these plans. As a minimum, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires that the following elements be included in emergency action plans:

a. Emergency escape route assignments and procedures.

b. Procedures for employees who must remain to operate critical operations before they evacuate.

c. Procedures to account for employees after evacuation.

d. Rescue and medical duties.

e. Means for reporting emergencies.

f. Persons or departments to contact for further information.

In addition to the above, all JSC emergency action plans must also incorporate the elements of a fire prevention plan. These elements are as follows:

a. A list of the major workplace fire hazards and their proper handling and storage procedures.

b. Potential ignition sources (such as welding, smoking, and others) and their control procedures.

c. The type of fire protection equipment or systems available in the building.

To obtain a copy of "Tips for Writing an Emergency Action Plan," contact either the JSC EPO, the JSC Health, Safety, and Environmental Compliance Office, or your building's facility manager.

### After

**This could be you . . .**

Several people could have been exposed to a toxic gas because they left their buildings after the gas release. They didn't know what to do.

A fire in an area with hazardous materials burned longer than it should have while firefighters tried to find out if they could use water on the fire. Little planning had been done for this emergency.

A computer area was flooded when a water line broke. The emergency plan didn't cover water leaks.

1\. Who must follow this chapter?

You must follow this chapter if you work at JSC or a JSC field site. If you are a supervisor, facility manager, or director, Paragraph 16 of this chapter lists your responsibilities.

2\. What does this chapter cover?

This chapter tells you what to do in an emergency of any kind and what emergency planning JSC must do.
