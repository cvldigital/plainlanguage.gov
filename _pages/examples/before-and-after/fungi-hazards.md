_This example was created for training and is not official agency text._

* #### Before

  Flood conditions contribute to the growth and transmission of many kinds of fungi, some of which can cause sickness. Cleanup workers are at increased risk of exposure to airborne fungi and their spores because they often handle moldy building materials, decaying vegetable matter, rotting waste material, and other fungus-contaminated debris. The fungal material is carried into the respiratory tract when airborne particles are inhaled.

* #### After

  Be careful when cleaning up after a flood. You may be exposed to and breathe in unhealthy mold in:

  - The air
  - Damp building materials
  - Decaying vegetable matter
  - Rotting waste material
  - Any other damp debris
