* #### Before

  Mitigation is the cornerstone of emergency management. It's the ongoing effort to lessen the impact disasters have on people's lives and property through damage prevention and flood insurance. Through measures such as, building safely within the floodplain or removing homes altogether; engineering buildings and infrastructures to withstand earthquakes: and creating and enforcing effective building codes to protect property from floods, hurricanes and other natural hazards, the impact on lives and communities is lessened.

* #### After

  Protect your community from natural disasters!

  - Build safely in the flood zone, or remove buildings altogether
  - Engineer buildings and infrastructure to withstand earthquakes
  - Create and enforce effective building codes
