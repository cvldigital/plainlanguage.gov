Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. Here's an example of how the plain language concept, applied visually, can convey important safety information more effectively than words.

## Before

<div class="example-container">

This is a multipurpose passenger vehicle which will handle and maneuver differently from an ordinary passenger car, in driving conditions which may occur on streets and highways and off road. As with other vehicles of this type, if you make sharp turns or abrupt maneuvers, the vehicle may roll over or may go out of control and crash. You should read driving guidelines and instructions in the Owner's Manual, and WEAR YOUR SEAT BELTS AT ALL TIMES.

## After

<div class="example-container center">
