- [Warren Buffett]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/resources/guides/security-and-exchange-commission-a-plain-english-handbook.md %}) has been called the greatest stock-market investor of modern times. See what he says about plain language in this preface to the Security and Exchange Commission's _Plain English Handbook_.

- [Tommy Thompson]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link media/thompson.pdf %}), George W. Bush's former Secretary of Health and Human Services, has this to say about plain language and the federal plain language group.
