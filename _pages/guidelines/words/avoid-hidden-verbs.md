  title: Hidden Verbs
---

Use the strongest, most direct form of the verb possible.

Verbs are the fuel of writing - they give your sentences power and direction. They liven up your writing and make it more interesting. Too often, we hide verbs by turning them into nouns, making them less effective and using more words than we need.

Government writing is full of hidden verbs. They make our writing weak and longer than necessary. Say "we manage the program" and "we analyze data" not "we are responsible for management of the program" or "we conduct an analysis of the data."

## What are hidden verbs?

A hidden verb (or nominalization) is a verb converted into a noun. It often needs an extra verb to make sense. For example, "Please make an application for a personal loan" is longer and less clear than "Please apply for a personal loan."

Hidden verbs come in two forms. Some have endings such as _-ment_, _-tion_, _-sion_, and _-ance_ or link with verbs such as _achieve_, _effect_, _give_, _have_, _make_, _reach_, and _take_.

Hidden verbs also occur when we turn verbs into nouns by adding endings such as _-ing_, _-tion_, _-ment_, or _-sion_ and placing the longer word between the words "the" and "of."

Uncovering the hidden verb usually forces you to rephrase your sentence and cut out other poor habits such as wordy phrases. Hidden verbs often go hand in hand with passive verbs and combine to give an officious and longwinded style.
