You will confuse your audience if you use different terms for the same concept or object. For example, if you use the term "senior citizens" to refer to a group, continue to use this term throughout the material. Don't substitute another term, such as "the elderly" or "the aged." Using a different term may cause the reader to wonder if you're referring to the same group.

You don't need to use synonyms to make your writing more interesting. Federal writers are not creating literature. You are communicating requirements, how to get benefits, how to stay safe and healthy, and other information to help people in their lives. While using different words may make writing more interesting, it can decrease clarity.
