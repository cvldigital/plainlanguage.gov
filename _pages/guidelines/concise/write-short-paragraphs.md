Write short paragraphs and cover one topic per paragraph. Long paragraphs discourage users from even trying to understand your material. Short paragraphs are easier to read and understand.

Writing experts recommend paragraphs of no more than 150 words in three to eight sentences. Paragraphs should never be longer than 250 words. Vary the lengths of your paragraphs to make them more interesting. As with sentence length, if all paragraphs are the same size your writing will be choppy.

There is nothing wrong with an occasional one-sentence paragraph.

Using short paragraphs is an ideal way to open up your writing and create white space. In turn, this makes your writing more inviting and easier to read.

Along with breaking material up into shorter paragraphs, consider [adding headings for each paragraph]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/guidelines/organize/add-useful-headings.md %}) as we did in the following example.

## Example

* ### Long, dense paragraph
  #### Before

  **Flu Medication**

  A specific vaccine for humans that is effective in preventing avian influenza is not yet readily available. Based upon limited data, the CDC has suggested that the anti-viral medication Oseltamivir (brand name-Tamiflu) may be effective in treating avian influenza. Using this input, the Department of State has decided to pre-position the drug Tamiflu at its Embassies and Consulates worldwide, for eligible U.S. Government employees and their families serving abroad who become ill with avian influenza. We emphasize that this medication cannot be made available to private U.S. citizens abroad. Because of this, and because Tamiflu may not be readily available overseas, the State Department encourages American citizens traveling or living abroad to consult with their private physician about whether to obtain Tamiflu prior to travel, for use in the event treatment becomes necessary, or whether Tamiflu is readily available in the country where they reside. Americans should also be aware of the potential health risk posed by counterfeit drugs, including those represented as Tamiflu, by internet scam artists or in countries with lax regulations governing the production and distribution of pharmaceuticals. In addition, the Department of State has asked its embassies and consulates to consider preparedness measures that take into consideration the fact that travel into or out of a country may not be possible, safe or medically advisable. Guidance on how private citizens can prepare for a "stay in place" response, including stockpiling food, water, and medical supplies, is available on the CDC and pandemicflu.gov websites.

  **Flu medication for government employees**

  A specific vaccine for humans effective in preventing avian influenza is not yet readily available. Based on limited data, the CDC suggested that the anti-viral medication Oseltamivir (brand name-Tamiflu) may be effective in treating avian influenza. Using this input, the Department of State decided to pre-position the drug Tamiflu at its Embassies and Consulates worldwide, for eligible U.S. Government employees and their families serving abroad who become ill with avian influenza.

  **Flu medication for private citizens**

  We emphasize that we can't make this medication available to private U.S. citizens abroad. Because of this, and because Tamiflu may not be readily available overseas, the State Department encourages American citizens traveling or living abroad to consult with their private physician about whether to get Tamiflu before they travel, whether to use if treatment becomes necessary, or if Tamiflu is readily available in the country where they live.

  **Counterfeit drug warning**

  Americans should also be aware of the potential health risk posed by counterfeit drugs, including those represented as Tamiflu, by internet scam artists or in countries with lax regulations governing the production and distribution of pharmaceuticals.

  **Additional precautions**

  In addition, the Department of State has asked its embassies and consulates to consider preparedness measures that consider that travel into or out of a country may not be possible, safe or medically advisable. Guidance on how private citizens can prepare for a "stay in place" response, including stockpiling food, water, and medical supplies, is available on the CDC and pandemicflu.gov websites.

## Cover one topic in each paragraph

Limit each paragraph or section to one topic to make it easier for your audience to understand your information. Each paragraph should start with a topic sentence that captures the essence of everything in the paragraph.

Putting each topic in a separate paragraph makes your information easier to digest.

## Example

* #### Before

  Notice of a bid advertisement shall be published in at least one local newspaper and in one trade publication at least 30 days in advance of sale. If applicable, the notice must identify the reservation within which the tracts to be leased are found. Specific descriptions of the tracts shall be available at the office of the superintendent. The complete text of the advertisement shall be mailed to each person listed on the appropriate agency mailing list.

* #### After

  1. Thirty days before the sale, we will publish a notice advertising bids. The notice will be in at least one local newspaper and in one trade publication. It will identify any reservation where the tracts to be leased are located.

  2. We will share information about this process in two other ways. We will mail the advertisement to each person on the appropriate agency mailing list. We will also provide specific descriptions of the tracts at the superintendent's office.
