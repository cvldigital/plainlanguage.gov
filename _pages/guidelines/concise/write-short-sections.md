Short sections break up material so it appears easier to comprehend. Long, dense sections with no white space are visually unappealing, and give the impression your writing is difficult to understand. Short sections also help you organize your thoughts more effectively.

Short sections give you the opportunity to [add useful headings]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/guidelines/organize/add-useful-headings.md %}), which help the reader skim and scan the page. Long sections are impossible to summarize meaningfully in a heading. When you break up different concepts into short sections, each heading can give the reader a clear picture of what's in that section.

## Example

* ### Long, dense paragraphs
  #### Before

  **§ 2653.30 Native group selections**

  (a) Selections must not exceed the amount recommended by the regional corporation or 320 acres for each Native member of a group, or 7,680 acres for each Native group, whichever is less. Native groups must identify any acreage over that as alternate selections and rank their selections. Beyond the reservations in sections 2650.32 and 2650.46 of this Part, conveyances of lands in a National Wildlife Refuge are subject to the provisions of section 22(g) of ANCSA and section 2651.41 of this chapter as though they were conveyances to a village corporation.

  (b) Selections must be contiguous and the total area selected must be compact except where separated by lands that are unavailable for selection. BLM will not consider the selection compact if it excludes lands available for selection within its exterior boundaries; or an isolated tract of public land of less than 640 acres remains after selection. The lands selected must be in quarter sections where they are available unless exhaustion of the group's entitlement does not allow the selection of a quarter section. The selection must include all available lands in less than quarter sections. Lands selected must conform as nearly as practicable to the United States lands survey system.

* ### Material divided paragraphs
  #### After

  **§ 2653.31 What are the selection criteria for Native group selections and what lands are available?**

  You may select only the amount recommended by the regional corporation or 320 acres for each Native member of a group, or 7,680 acres for each Native group, whichever is less. You must identify any acreage over 7,680 as alternate selections and rank their selection.

  **§ 2653.32 What are the restrictions in conveyances to Native groups?**

  Beyond the reservations described in this part conveyances of lands in a National Wildlife Refuge are subject to section 22(g) of ANSCA as though they were conveyances to a village.

  **§ 2653.33 Do Native group selections have to share a border?**

  Yes, selections must share a border. The total area you select must be compact except where separated by lands that are unavailable for selection. We will not consider your selection if:

  (a) It excludes lands available for selection within its exterior boundaries; or

  (b) An isolated tract of public land of less than 640 acres remains after selection.

  **§ 2653.34 How small a parcel can I select?**

  Select lands in quarter sections where they are available unless there is not enough left in your group's entitlement to allow this. Your election must include all available lands in areas that are smaller than quarter sections. Conform your selection as much as possible to the United States land survey system.
